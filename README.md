Interfacing Lua with C/C++ Example Set
======================================

Breeding ground for examples on how to interface C++ to Lua.  This include several read-evaluate-print loop (REPL) examples.

Directories & Examples
----------------------

* build/premake: premake tool and scripts to create build files.

* lua-5.3.5: Lua source code

Lua

* app1: application with built-in lua-based test capability

* lua: stock lua REPL included with distribution

* luac: stock lua compiler (i.e., luac) included with distribution

* repl-cpp: C++ version of REPL

* repl-extend: stock lua REPL with extended C++ functions. The lua REPL is compiled with C++, not C.

* repl-simple: simple and dumb REPL

* sol2-app1: simple sol2-based application

* sol2-app2: sol2-based application that interfaces with a C function
